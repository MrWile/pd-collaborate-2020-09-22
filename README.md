# Teacher Professional Development Session 2: Collaborating with GitHub

## Assignment

Let's create merge conflicts!

1. Click the `Fork` button in the top right corner to generate your own copy of this repository.
2. In your `locations.md` file, list where you are from (this can be where you live, where your school is located, your hometown, or where you'd rather be right now ðŸ˜„).
3. Commit your changes.
4. Click on your Pull Requests tab. Verify your Pull Request configuration and changes, then click `Create Pull Request`.
5. If you have a merge conflict, you'll need to resolve it before you can submit your pull request. The merge conflict will look like this:

```
<<<<<<< new branch
changes
=======
original
>>>>>>> original-branch
```

Delete the lines with <<<, >>>, and ===. Edit the changes so that the final result includes your city but doesn't remove anyone else's city.  
6. Once you have completed your pull request, wait for the facilitator to approve your changes and "pull" them into the original repository.
